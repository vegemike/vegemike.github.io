(;) \n (**done_really**) \nfinal step is \'\'\'ch3\u200bcoo(−)+CoA+atp→[acetyl−CoA]+amp+ppi\'\'\' \nuh so ch3coo is the result of the last bit, CoA activates it and atp provides energy. \\n \ncatalysed by acetyl-CoA synthetase (acs) \\n \natp binds to acetate, transferring a phosphate group to form acetyl-amp \\n \namp and ppi get released, and ppi gets broken down into two separate phosphates \\n \ncoenzyme a (CoA) comes in and replaces the amp, forming acetyl-CoA \\n \nacetyl-CoA can be used to make energy by kreb\'s. \\n \nextra acetyl-coa gets turned into fatty acids, these get stored as triglycerides in liver cells, leading to fatty liver disease \n(;)\nthats all thanks']</div>
