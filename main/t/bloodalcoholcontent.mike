biochemical effects of high blood alcohol on the liver%
causes of damage etc&
ethanol isnt great for the liver when theres a lot of it. but like why????? \n 
liver makes things less toxic by like turning them into things that are less toxic (crazy) but when it does this to ethanol the intermediate chemicals are bad too!!

 (**ethanol_pathways**) 
so first step is the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase dehydrogenases the alcohol. this combines the ethanol with "nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide" but i dont know what that is so yeah. they react like 
''' ch3ch2oh + nad(+) → ch3cho + nadh + h(+) ''' 
so this gets rid of the hydrogen at the end and makes something called acetaldehyde which is supposedly a lot worse \n 
full mechanism is: \n 
adh binds ethanol at its active site, which contains a zinc ion (zn²⁺) \n 
zinc stabilises the oxygen on the -oh, making it oxidise better. \n 
nad⁺ acts as the electron acceptor, stealing two electrons and a hydrogen from ethanol, turning it into nadh. \n 
the remaining ethanol structure rearranges into acetaldehyde (ch₃cho), which is reactive to like proteins and dna (bad) \n 
acetaldehyde is a bastard because it causes cancer and like inflammation and kills protein function
(;) 
okay next is the more creaively named aldehyde dehydrogenase which dehydrogenases the aldehyde \n 
 ''' ch3cho + nad(+) + h2o → ch3coo(−) + nadh + 2h+ ''' 
virtually same mechanism as above. this takes time though so like  if you drink too much too fast acetaldehyde builds up before the enzyme can handle it. this is what causes hangovers. (;) 
 (**done_really**) 
final step is ''' ch3​coo(−)+CoA+atp→[acetyl−CoA]+amp+ppi ''' 
uh so ch3coo is the result of the last bit, CoA activates it and atp provides energy. \n 
catalysed by acetyl-CoA synthetase (acs) \n 
atp binds to acetate, transferring a phosphate group to form acetyl-amp \n 
amp and ppi get released, and ppi gets broken down into two separate phosphates \n 
coenzyme a (CoA) comes in and replaces the amp, forming acetyl-CoA \n 
acetyl-CoA can be used to make energy by kreb's. \n 
extra acetyl-coa gets turned into fatty acids, these get stored as triglycerides in liver cells, leading to fatty liver disease

thats all thanks
