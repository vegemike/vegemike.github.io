(**summary**) 
this is the first real post i am making here, so i thought i would do it with the show i finished last night. i took quite a while to get through hyouka, but that does not mean i disliked the show: it follows the life of 4 highschool kids, each a part of the classic literature club. they solve mysteries and just generally hang out, like a sherlockian lives-of-highschoolers show. \n the characters are quite nice, theres oreki, bit pretentious but thats probably intentional to show his like progression or something. he lives on the motto 'If I don't have to do something, I won't, but if I have to, I'll do it quickly', and is the main "problem solver".

(**thoughts**) 
it is a nice show, beautifully made, clearly with a lot of love. i watched it over a period of nearly 3 months which kept it from getting stale for me, but i can see that being an issue. it's a little forgettable and doesnt take romance or intercharacter relationships anywhere until the last few episodes. i enjoy the characters themselves, although oreki can get a bit annoying. the mysteries they have to solve are also quite fun, but dont bother trying to solve them yourself.
