It has long been controversial to claim that fish experience pain. \\n \nAs Singer said:\n \'\'\'  "We do not assume newborn infants, people suffering from neurodegenerative brain diseases or people with learning disabilities experience less pain than we would." \'\'\' \n (;) \n (**Piscine_Pain_Reception**) \nFish possess specialized nerve endings called nociceptors, which are sensory neurons that detect noxious stimuli. Nociceptors in fish are found in the skin, lips, fins, and other peripheral areas, and they respond to mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli. \\n \nMammals possess a similar set of pain receptors. When activated, nociceptors generate electrical signals that travel via afferent nerve fibres to the central nervous system. \\n \n (**Neural_Pathways**) \nFish lack a neocortex (the part of the mammalian brain associated with conscious pain perception), but they still have brain structures that process pain-like stimuli. \\n\nAs in the "Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness": \n\'\'\' The absence of a neocortex does not appear to preclude an organism from experiencing affective states. Convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals have the neuroanatomical, neurochemical, and neurophysiological substrates of conscious states along with the capacity to exhibit intentional behaviours. Consequently, the weight of evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the neurological substrates that generate consciousness. Non-human animals, including all mammals and birds, and many other creatures, including octopuses, also possess these neurological substrates. \'\'\' \nThe fish spinal cord is capable of reflexively withdrawing from pain, whilst the medulla and midbrain coordinate pain receptors. \\n \nThe telencephalon in fish potentially allows for some level of conscious pain perception. Fish display learned avoidance behaviours after experiencing painful stimuli, linked to the pallium, similar to the mammalian cortex. \\n \nAny evidence that fish respond to pain in ways beyond reflex should set off alarm bells. (;) \n(**Physiological_and_Behavioural_Responses**) \nWhen exposed to painful stimuli, fish release cortisol, a stress hormone. Gene expression changes, and breathing and heart rates alter. \\n \nBehaviourally, fish learn avoidance behaviours, stop eating, rub/shake affected areas (like a human upon stubbing a toe) and memory can be impaired. One thing of note, fish given painkillers return to normal behaviours, indicating a reduction in pain. Akin to all mammals. (More on this later). \n\\n \\n\nIn short: While fish likely do not experience pain with the same emotional complexity as mammals, the presence of higher-order processing in their brain suggests they do feel more than just a reflexive reaction, making it almost objective to say that fish feel pain. Numerous studies are convincing in their detailing of fish responses and pain function. The pathways are practically identical to their mammalian counterparts, with the function of the neocortex being replaced by the pallium and other brain cores. (;) \n(**Okay,_Fish_Feel_Pain._So_What?**) \nSome fish slaughter methods: \\n \\n \n- Asphyxiation (Suffocation in Air or on Ice). Fish remain conscious during this process, which can last minutes to hours. \\n \n- Live Chilling (Icing in Slurry). Fish are dumped into ice-water, which slows the metabolism. This is not an effective way to render fish unconscious. They stay aware for 20-60 minutes. \\n \n- Bleeding (without stunning). The major arteries or gills of the fish are slit. The fish remains conscious for minutes. \\n \n- Percussive Stunning (Blunt Force Trauma). A hard force to the head of the fish renders them unconscious. \\n \n- Electrical Stunning. Some systems don\'t fully stun fish, and they regain consciousness before slaughter. \\n \n\\n \nThe execution of land-animals is similarly horrific, but better regulated. Land animals are generally required to be stunned first, whereas stunning for fish is less standardized and less effective compared to land animals. \\n \nAquaculture conditions include overcrowding and poor water quality (ammonia buildup, poor oxygenation). Frequent handling for vaccinations, sorting, and transport can lead to skin injuries, stress responses, and death, while being transported long distances without anesthesia leads to even higher stress and mortality. \\n \nDisease and mortality rates in aquaculture can be extremely high due to poor water conditions and high stocking densities. (;)\nSo, fish welfare is significantly worse than that of land animals, despite growing evidence that fish have complex cognition, learning abilities, and pain perception. Many fish species form long-term social relationships and display cooperative behaviors, while some fish (e.g., cichlids, trout) can recognize individual humans, solve puzzles, and learn from experience. Regardless of these facts, over 70 billion land animals are slaughtered annually, but trillions of fish are killed (both farmed and wild-caught), with less concern for suffering. In other words, relative to their mental capacity, fish welfare is disproportionately poor. \\n \nthink of this next time you go to eat fish!! or any animal!! i haven\'t written about land-dwelling animals, but don\'t take that to mean that\'s acceptable at all.']</div>
