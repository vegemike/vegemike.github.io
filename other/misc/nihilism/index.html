(;) one thing i\'ve been confronting lately (which, as a vegan, disturbs me the most) is that i dont really get why suffering is bad most of the time. thats just chemicals and electricity, whats wrong with slaughterhouses; once the thing dies those chemicals go to do anything else and its suffering has made no real change to the universe - why care?? sure, i care if I suffer, but other things?? why should i?? google just tells me a load of evangelical nonsense. im staying vegan, and i think suffering is bad, i just cant work out why. (;) \nis not seeing a point in life a reason to end it? no, probably not. \\n is not trusting that anything is really actually "there" a reason to do the same? no. \\n if people want to, should they be allowed to? no. \\n is death bad? i dont really know. sometimes i guess. (;) \nam i a nihilist now? god i hope not. im still going to carry on carrying on. in fact, im pretty much over my little nihilist stunt from 5 minutes ago and just want a record of this!! no life updates or anything more to say about this. although, i\'ve been finding my tolerance for other people is dropping exponentially atm, some people just i cannot stand \\n also i just needed anything to blog post about']</div>
