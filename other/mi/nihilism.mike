nihilism%
 &
ive always clowned on nihilists. the whole idea that everything is pointless and sucks just felt both really surface level and just an upsetting view to hold. its so unfulfilling and to be honest, if you dont see a point in life, why are you still here?? clearly theres something tethering them to life. \n over time though, ive been finding myself in periods of more and more nihilist tendencies, however silly it might sound. im writing this during one of those. nihilism, like solipsism, is more of a fact than a philosophy. absurdism is also just silly. there is no provable point to human life (or the life of anything) and most religion is a waste of time. (;) one thing i've been confronting lately (which, as a vegan, disturbs me the most) is that i dont really get why suffering is bad most of the time. thats just chemicals and electricity, whats wrong with slaughterhouses; once the thing dies those chemicals go to do anything else and its suffering has made no real change to the universe - why care?? sure, i care if I suffer, but other things?? why should i?? google just tells me a load of evangelical nonsense. im staying vegan, and i think suffering is bad, i just cant work out why. (;) 
is not seeing a point in life a reason to end it? no, probably not. \n is not trusting that anything is really actually "there" a reason to do the same? no. \n if people want to, should they be allowed to? no. \n is death bad? i dont really know. sometimes i guess. (;) 
am i a nihilist now? god i hope not. im still going to carry on carrying on. in fact, im pretty much over my little nihilist stunt from 5 minutes ago and just want a record of this!! no life updates or anything more to say about this. although, i've been finding my tolerance for other people is dropping exponentially atm, some people just i cannot stand \n also i just needed anything to blog post about
